# Network-Attack-Detection-ML-Algorithms
This project is focused on constructing detection models for classifying network attack data. To keep the scenario close to the real world and account for the evolving nature of network technology, the UNSW-NB15 network data set, which includes both normal and current low-level attack trades, is used. It applies logistic regression and decision tree models for binary classification and a KNN model for categorizing the multi-class. The decision tree achieved an impressive 99.99% accuracy, vastly surpassing logistic regression's 78.15%. However, the KNN model achieved an average testing accuracy of around 23% for ten category classifi—Åation.
